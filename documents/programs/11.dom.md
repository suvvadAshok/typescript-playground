Write the following components using only HTML, CSS and TypeScript. You shouldn't use any third party css or dom library.

1. Implement a counter component. You should have two buttons, one for incrementing and another for decrementing count. Something similar to stackoverflow up/down vote component.

2. Write an Accordion component. An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each contain a title, content snippet representing a section of content. The headings function as controls that enable users to reveal or hide their associated sections of content. Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when presenting multiple sections of content on a single page.

3. Implement a simple color picker component. You should use three slider controls for 'red', 'green', 'blue' components. Have a simple box to display the selected color.

4. Write a simple calendar-month-view component. Have two input controls to select month and year. When the selection changes, display that month's calendar.

5. Implement Tic Tac Toe game

6. Implement number shuffle game, with a grid of 4x4. The grid should have numbers from 1 to 15 in random order. The user should be able to click on a number and move it to the adjacent empty space. The game is won when the numbers are in ascending order.

7. Implement a simple todo component. Support adding, deleting and marking todo items as done.
